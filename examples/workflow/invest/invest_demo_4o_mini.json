Pass file discovery results to subsequent tasks for efficient data loading\n9. Each task should focus on its specific responsibility while using data from previous tasks\n10. **MANDATORY**: Every agent that needs data MUST use the \"read\" tool to read actual files\n11. **MANDATORY**: Never assume file contents - always read them using the \"read\" tool\n12. **MANDATORY**: If a file exists, read it; if it doesn't exist, report that clearly\n\n## Critical Instructions:\n- **information_collection agent**: Use tool to discover all files in the data folder, extract investment personality, and pass file list to next task\n- **data_loading agent**: Use tool to read relevant files based on file names and paths, distinguish content by file type\n- **trading_analysis agent**: Analyze market data from loaded files and generate trading recommendations\n\n- **report_generation agent**: Compile all analysis into comprehensive report - **analysis_writer agent**: Copy the trading report and add comprehensive professional analysis directly into it\n- Base all decisions on actual data from files\n- Include specific numbers for all recommendations (prices, quantities, percentages)\n- Present complete data tables without truncation\n- Return the entire report content without summarization\n- Provide professional explanations for all trading decisions\n- Consider current positions and available capital in decision making\n- Do not save files - return the complete report content as output\n- **CRITICAL**: Each agent MUST use tool to read actual files - NEVER make up data\n- **CRITICAL**: Present ALL data from all files - do not omit, truncate, or summarize any data\n- **CRITICAL**: NEVER use fake, estimated, or placeholder data - ONLY use real data from files\n- **CRITICAL**: If past report path is provided, read that file and use it for performance review\n- **CRITICAL**: Show complete data tables with every row and every column from all files\n- **CRITICAL**: Do not make up data if files are empty - report the actual file contents\n- **CRITICAL**: The tool is MANDATORY for accessing any file data\n- **CRITICAL**: If you cannot read a file, report the error but do not invent data\n- **PERSONALITY-BASED ANALYSIS**: The LLM should embody the investment personality/strategy and write the report from that specific perspective, not just recommend strategies\n- **STRATEGY EMBODIMENT**: For aggressive strategy, write as an aggressive investor; for conservative, write as a conservative investor; for neutral, write as a balanced investor",
