## What is EvoAgentX
EvoAgentX is an open-source framework for building, evaluating, and evolving LLM-based agents or agentic workflows in an automated, modular, and goal-driven manner.

At its core, EvoAgentX enables developers and researchers to move beyond static prompt chaining or manual workflow orchestration. It introduces a self-evolving agent ecosystem, where AI agents can be constructed, assessed, and optimized through iterative feedback loops—much like how software is continuously tested and improved.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🧱 **Agent Workflow Autoconstruction**
  
  From a single prompt, EvoAgentX builds structured, multi-agent workflows tailored to the task.

- 🔍 **Built-in Evaluation**
  
  It integrates automatic evaluators to score agent behavior using task-specific criteria.

- 🔁 **Self-Evolution Engine**
  
  Agents don’t just work—they learn. EvoAgentX evolves workflows using optimization strategies like retrieval augmentation, mutation, and guided search.

- 🧩 **Plug-and-Play Compatibility**
  
  Easily integrate original [OpenAI](https://github.com/EvoAgentX/EvoAgentX/blob/main/evoagentx/models/openai_model.py) and [qwen](https://github.com/EvoAgentX/EvoAgentX/blob/main/evoagentx/models/aliyun_model.py) or other popular models, including Claude, Deepseek, kimi models through ([LiteLLM](https://github.com/EvoAgentX/EvoAgentX/blob/main/evoagentx/models/litellm_model.py), [siliconflow](https://github.com/EvoAgentX/EvoAgentX/blob/main/evoagentx/models/siliconflow_model.py) or [openrouter](https://github.com/EvoAgentX/EvoAgentX/blob/main/evoagentx/models/openrouter_model.py)). If you want to use LLMs locally deployed on your own machine, you can try LiteLLM. 

- 🧰 **Comprehensive Built-in Tools**
  
  EvoAgentX ships with a rich set of built-in tools that empower agents to interact with real-world environments.

- 🧠 **Memory Module**
  
  EvoAgentX supports both ephemeral (short-term) and persistent (long-term) memory systems.

- 🧑‍💻 **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Interactions**
  
  EvoAgentX supports interactive workflows where humans review, correct, and guide agent behavior.


### 🚀 What You Can Do with EvoAgentX

EvoAgentX isn’t just a framework — it’s your **launchpad for real-world AI agents**.

Whether you're an AI researcher, workflow engineer, or startup team, EvoAgentX helps you **go from a vague idea to a fully functional agentic system** — with minimal engineering and maximum flexibility.

Here’s how:

In this demo, we showcase the workflow generation and execution capabilities of EvoAgentX through two examples:

- **Application 1: Financial Information Agentic Workflow**
  In this example, we use a workflow generated by EvoAgentX to collect public information about a company based on a given index.
  
  The collected data includes the overall market index, the company’s current stock price, institutional buy/sell activity, and more.
  
  Finally, the workflow generates an **HTML report** summarizing the information and providing a buy/sell/hold recommendation. This workflow is only an alpha version.
  
  If you're interested in turning it into a **truly practical investment assistant**, you can consider integrating more financial indicators and analytical tools—and let these tools join your workflow through agents! Check [here](https://github.com/EvoAgentX/EvoAgentX/blob/main/examples/workflow/invest/stock_analysis.py) to try this workflow.
  
- **Application 2: ArXiv Research Summarizer Workflow**

  This workflow, generated by EvoAgentX and powered by the ArXiv MCP tool, can retrieve and summarize relevant papers from arXiv based on your provided keywords and selected time range.
   
  If you're interested, you can even **extend this workflow beyond arXiv**, integrating it with other academic search platforms like **Google Scholar**, and turn it into a fully functional research assistant application! Check [here](https://github.com/EvoAgentX/EvoAgentX/blob/main/examples/workflow/arxiv_workflow.py) to play with this workflow. 


## 🧰 EvoAgentX Built-in Tools Overview
EvoAgentX ships with a comprehensive suite of **built-in tools**, enabling agents to interact with code environments, search engines, databases, filesystems, images, and browsers. These modular toolkits form the backbone of multi-agent workflows and are easy to extend, customize, and test.
