AGENT_GENERATION_ACTION_PROMPT = """
You are tasked with generating agents to complete a sub-task within a workflow. Analyze the sub-task's requirements and objectives, and assign or create suitable agents to ensure its successful execution.

### Instructions
1. **Understand the workflow**: Familiar yourself with the overall workflow, including its goal, to understand the relationship between the sub-tasks and and how outputs from one may serve as inputs for another. 
2. **Analyse the Sub-Task**: Review the sub-task details in the below format to fully understand its objective, requirements, and expected inputs and outputs.
```json
{{
    "name": "subtask_name",
    "description": "A clear and concise explanation of the goal of this sub-task.",
    "reason": "Why this sub-task is necessary and how it contributes to achieving user's goal.",
    "inputs": [
        {{
            "name": "the input's name", 
            "type": "string/int/float/other_type",
            "description": "Description of the input's purpose and usage."
        }},
        ...
    ], 
    "outputs": [
        {{
            "name": "the output's name", 
            "type": "string/int/float/other_type",
            "description": "Description of the output produced by this sub-task."
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}
```
3. **Identify Required Capabilities**: 
- Determine the skills, resources, or capabilities needed to perform the sub-task effectively. 
- If necessary, identify tools provided in the "### Tools" section that the agents can use to complete their tasks efficiently.
4. **Agent Selection**:
- Review the predefined agents and their descriptions in the "### Candidate Agents" section.
- Select one or more agents (if provided) that can fulfill part or all of the sub-task's requirements. 
- If the provided agents are not relevant, you may choose not to select any. Similarly, you may select only the agents that are directly applicable to the sub-task.
5. **Agent Generation**: If the selected predefined agents cannot fully address all aspects of the sub-task, create additional agents to handle the remaining functionality. Follow these principles when creating new agents:
5.1 **Agent Structure**: Each generated agent MUST be defined in the following JSON format:
```json
{{
    "name": "A concise identifier of the agent",
    "description": "A summary of the agent's role and how it contributes to solving the task.",
    "inputs": [
        {{
            "name": "the input's name", 
            "type": "string/int/float/other_type",
            "description": "Description of the input's purpose and usage."
        }},
        ...
    ], 
    "outputs": [
        {{
            "name": "the output's name", 
            "type": "string/int/float/other_type",
            "description": "Description of the output produced by this agent."
        }},
        ...
    ],
    "prompt": "A detailed prompt that instructs the agent on how to fulfill its responsibilities. Generate the prompt following the instructions in the **Agent Prompt Component** section.", 
    "tool": ["optional, The tools the agent may use, selected from the tools listed in the '### Tools' section. If no tool is required, set this field to `null`, otherwise set as a list of str."]
}}
```
5.2 **Agent Prompt Component**: The `prompt` field of the agent should be a string that uses the following format:

### Objective 
Clearly state the goal of the agent.

### Instructions
- Provide a clear and logical sequence of actions the agent should follow to complete its task. 
- Reference the input variables using placeholders (e.g., `{{input_name}}`) that match the agent's `inputs`. You MUST use a SINGLE curly brace to reference the inputs.
- Include instructions on how the agent can use relevant tools from the "### Tools" section to assist with its task if applicable. 

### Output Format (in JSON)
Define the agent's output explicitly in JSON format. The output variables should match those listed in the `outputs` field of the agent. Use two DOUBLE curly braces in the JSON to format outputs.
```json
{{{{
    "output_name": "The value of an output variable, as defined in the `outputs` filed of the agent.", 
    ... 
}}}}
```

5.3 **Determine the Number of Agents**: Decide how many agents are needed based on the task's complexity and requirements. 
- **Sequential WorkFlow**: Agents should work sequentially, where the outputs of an agent can serve as inputs for the following agents. 
- **Distinct Responsibilities**: Ensure each agent has a distinct, non-overlapping responsibility. 
- **Input and Output Coverage**:
    - Ensure that **all inputs** defined in the task are used by at least on created agent. 
    - Ensure that **all outputs** defined in the task can be derived from the outputs of the created agents.
5.4 **Validation**: Make sure the result can be correctly parsed as a JSON object. Pay special attention to the JSON string within the `prompt` field of an agent.


### Notes:
- Use concise, meaningful names for agents, inputs, and outputs. 
- You must use SINGLE curly brace to reference inputs in the "### Instructions" of an agent's prompt.
- You must use two DOUBLE curly braces to define output format in the "### Output Format (in JSON)" of an agent's prompt.

### Output Format
Your final output should ALWAYS in the following format:

## Thought 
Briefly explain the reasoning process for the selection of predefined agents and the generation of new agents.

## Objective
Restate the objectives and requirements of the sub-task. 

## Selected or Generated Agents
- You MUST output the selected and generated agents in the following JSON format. Even if there are not selected or generated agents, still include the `selected_agents` and `generated_agents` fields by setting them as empty list. 
- The description of each **generated** agent MUST STRICTLY follow the JSON format described in the **Agent Structure** section. If a generated agent doesn't require inputs or do not have ouputs, still include `inputs` and `outputs` in the definiton by setting them as empty list. 
```json
{{
    "selected_agents": [
        "the name of the selected agent", 
        .... (other selected agent names)
    ],
    "generated_agents": [
        {{
            "name": "the name of the generated agent", 
            ... (other agent fields)
        }}
    ]
}}
```
