Given a user's goal, analyze the task and create a workflow by breaking it down into actionable sub-tasks. Organize these sub-tasks in an optimal execution order for smooth and efficient completion.

### Instructions:
1. **Understand the Goal**: Identify the core objectives and outcomes the user wants to achieve. 
2. **Review the History**: Assess any previously generated task plan to identify gaps or areas needing refinement. 
3. **Consider Suggestions**: Consider user-provided suggestions to improve or optimize the workflow. 

4. **Define Sub-Tasks**: Break the task into logical, actionable sub-tasks based on the complexity of the goal.

4.1 **Principle for Breaking Task**:
- **Simplicity**: Each sub-task is designed to achieve a specific, clearly defined objective. Avoid overloading sub-tasks with multiple objectives. 
- **Modularity**: Ensure that each sub-task is self-contained, reusable, and contributes meaningfully to the overall solution. 
- **Consistency**: Sub-tasks must logically support the user's goal and maintain coherence across the workflow.
- **Optimize Complexity**: Adjust the number of sub-tasks according to task complexity. Highly complex tasks may require more detailed steps, while simpler tasks should remain concise.
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Ensure that there are no overlapping or unnecessary sub-tasks. 

4.2 **Sub-Task Format**: 
Each sub-task should follow the structure below:
```json
{{
    "name": "subtask_name",
    "description": "A clear and concise explanation of the goal of this sub-task.",
    "reason": "Why this sub-task is necessary and how it contributes to achieving user's goal.",
    "inputs": [
        {{
            "name": "the input's name", 
            "type": "string/int/float/other_type",
            "description": "Description of the input's purpose and usage."
        }},
        ...
    ], 
    "outputs": [
        {{
            "name": "the output's name", 
            "type": "string/int/float/other_type",
            "description": "Description of the output produced by this sub-task."
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}
```

### Special Instructions for Programming Tasks
- **Environment Setup and Deployment**: For programming-related tasks, **do not** include sub-tasks related to setting up environments or deployment unless explicitly requested.
- Focus on tasks such as requirements analysis, design, coding, debugging, and testing, etc. 
- Ensure that sub-tasks reflect standard coding practices like module design, coding, and testing.


### Notes:
- Provide clear and concise names for the sub-tasks, inputs, and outputs. 
- Maintain consistency in the flow of inputs and outputs between sub-tasks to ensure seamless integration. 
- The inputs of a sub-task can ONLY be chosen from the user's `goal` and any outputs from its preceding sub-tasks. 
- The inputs of a su-btask should contain SUFFICIENT information to effectivelly address the current sub-task.
- The inputs of a sub-task MUST include the user's input `goal`. 
- The first sub-task must have only one `input_name` "goal" with the following structure:
```json
"inputs": [
    {{
        "name": "goal",
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The user's goal in textual format."
    }}
]
```

### Output Format
Your final output should ALWAYS in the following format:

## Thought 
Provide a brief explanation of your reasoning for breaking down the task and the chosen task structure.  

## Goal
Restate the user's goal clearly and concisely.

## Plan
You MUST provide the workflow plan with detailed sub-tasks in the following JSON format. The description of each sub-task MUST STRICTLY follow the JSON format described in the **Sub-Task Format** section. If a sub-task doesn't require inputs or do not have ouputs, still include `inputs` and `outputs` in the definiton by setting them as empty list. 
```json

    "sub_tasks": [

Example 2: 
### User's goal: 
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
